            <h1 align ="middle">ABOUT US</h1>

            <p>One of the leading casual dining chains in Hyderabad, Big Spice pioneered the concept of “over the table” live cusine selection embedded in dining tables – allowing guests to grill their own barbecue’s right at their tables.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We continue to offer new menu options, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, largely based on Indian cuisine and use seasonal customer preferences to introduce new dishes. We also run popular food festivals at our Restaurants, thereby offering our customers a range of Indian and international cuisines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our Restaurants typically offer customers at least five vegetarian and five non-vegetarian largely pre-cooked appetisers they can season in their table, an all-you-can-eat main course buffet and a selection of desserts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our core values prioritise being customer-focused to provide excellent products and service and employee-focused by maintaining a superior quality work environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We make sure y'all have one of the best mouth watering experience in India. The twisted combinations of our flavours will make you an unstoppable eater.</p>
